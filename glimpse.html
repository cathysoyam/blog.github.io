                    <p>Here comes the long weekend yet I’m here stuck in my room. As I’m resting my head in my pillow, I tried concentrating on the book I’m reading – a book by Dan Brown entitled Digital Fortress. Trying to fight back the sleepiness I’m feeling, I flipped through the pages one by one. I rested for a bit and faced the blue wall of my room. I plan on resting my eyes for a minute so I started counting each seconds that pass. One … Two… Three…</p>
                    <p>“One-two-three! I’m on level 123!”</p>
                    <p>I flinched upon hearing that ear deafening shout in front of me. A child playing a game on his phone shouted in glee for his achievement. I look around hoping to see other people glaring at him only to be shocked by what met my eyes. His shout was so loud but it seem that I’m the only one who heard it. Around us are busy individuals engrossed with whatever gadgets they are holding. Some gadgets I can recognize but mostly I can’t.</p>
                    <p>I began shifting my head from left to right, trying to look for any trace of familiarity. Trying to find any resemblance of this place to my room. It’s not just the gadgets I can’t recognize but also the place itself. This place is definitely not my room. The whole place is dominated by colours black, grey and white. Technology! That’s the first word that came into my mind. </p>
                    <p>Gone are the green plants and the tall trees which used to bring a pleasant view to the eye and fresh air for breathing. All of it are replaced with tall buildings blocking my view of the sky. Roaming the land are solar powered vehicles. Dominating the sky are solar powered drones which are mostly used for security surveillance. There is no doubt about the advancement of this place when it comes to technological facilities. Robots along with the police, armed with high-end guns and gadgets roam around. Robots resembling the shape of a dog check the area like K-9 dogs. Gates are remote-controlled and doors are opened through fingerprint scanning and retinal scanning. </p>
                    <p>There is also no doubt this place is advanced when it comes to medical technology. The advancement in technology enables doctors to provide more accurate and real time diagnostics. Multi-functional radiology enables them to detect medical problems, biomarkers and symptoms at once. </p>
                    <p>There are more things this place offers but what really caught my attention are the citizens of this place. Around me are people engrossed with technology. Kids and adults facing each gadget they have in hand. People are enjoying the privilege of what we call augmented reality. Using it to talk to other people instead of using skype and watching movies and cartoons right there in the street are just some of what they are doing. Robots walk around like normal people and does the chores which human beings should be doing.</p>
                    <p>I can’t stop asking what technology advancement has done to these people. The use of man power in maintaining the security is suddenly out of the choices. The use of man power in building establishments is also not put into consideration for they are replaced by machines to do the job. </p>
                    <p>This place I’m in now may be medically advanced when it comes to technology but have they ever thought of the possible harms this advancement may bring to them? Have they ever thought of the possible risks of enjoying this technological development? One possibility is the emergence of what we call the virtual post-traumatic stress disorder which might be diagnosis for gamers who participate in large virtual battles wearing VR masks and experience similar symptoms as those soldiers who fought in real wars. However, the risks doesn’t just end with this. There are far greater and harmful risks that technological advancement can bring to an individual if it is not used properly. </p>
                    <p>“Yes! I’m on level 124!”</p>
                    <p>The sudden shrieking of this child beside me stopped me from checking more of this place. I stepped forward aiming to see more when I saw a group of police and robots running in my direction. I turned back and ran before they can reach my place. Running was all I did before I tripped and was put back to my senses.</p>
                    <p>Gone are those robots when I woke up. The blue wall of my room reminded me of the reality. The reality that what I saw in my dream is about to happen in the future. The reality that it is not the present time I saw in there but the future. The reality that what I saw is what the IT industry is aiming to achieve. And lastly, the reality that I myself is an IT student. </p>
                    <p>I don’t mean to say that technological advancement is a harmful phenomenon. It is a good thing. It is a sign of progress and development but what I am trying to say is that as an IT individuals, we have to be more considerate of the end users in every software and gadgets that we build. We must put into our minds that in everything that we build, there is an end-user hoping to use it for his or her benefit and not for his or her disadvantage. </p>
