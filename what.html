                    <p>Looking back, I can't stop thinking about what ifs. What if I've done that and done this? What if I was like that and like this? </p>
                    <p>Each one of us may have our own what ifs. Each one of us have our own regrets. But have you ever thought of the negative possibilities if you have done and you have been your what ifs? Have you ever thought of the negative possibilities if you haven't done the things you regret? Have you ever thought of the negative possibilities if you were the one you wished to be? </p>
                    <p>I, as an individual have a lot of what ifs. One of these concerns my age. "What if I started school when I was a bit older?" That was one of my biggest what ifs.</p> 
                    <p>I was in high school when they made my age a big deal. Being one of the youngest in the class have its pros and cons. I've experienced being belittled because of my age. My suggestions not taken into consideration because I am young. My skills disregarded beacuse I'm small and silent. But who would have thought that my next year in high school would be different? Who would have thought that they'd actually take my suggestions into consideration? Being young and silent, whou would have thought that I'd excell academically. This is where the positive things come in. I may be one of the youngest but those times, it seemed that I'm not. Being one of the youngest didn't stop me from bossing around. I was able to order those who are older than me. Assigning me as a leader also was their biggest mistake for I was the one who rejected their suggestions afterwards. Being known as one of the cream of the crop enabled me to order those students who have no idea of my age. I guess, my biggest defense against criticism before is that I'm young, small and terrible. </p>
                    <p>The circumstances right now made me thank my parents for sending me to school early. At least I'm not obliged to attend six years of high school. Being in a new environment where they don't really make a fuss towards your age is a new experience. Being in a new environment where some of my classmates are younger than me, "At least I'm not the youngest!" is all I could say. </p>
                    <p>It's normal to have but what ifs thinking of the positive side of what ifs alone is not normal. We must also put at the backs of our minds that a decision has two possible outcomes- the negative one and the positive one.  We must also think of the negative sides of our what ifs or rather stop thinking about those what ifs and just be happy and contented for what we have and what we are.</p>
